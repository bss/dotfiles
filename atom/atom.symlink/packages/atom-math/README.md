[atom.io pkg](https://atom.io/packages/atom-math)

Atom package for evaluating mathematical expressions using [Math.js](http://mathjs.org/) as interpreter.

### Simple expressions
When working with a buffer, just write an expression to be evaluated like `3 + 2`
or `cos(pi)`, then press the default hotkey `ctrl-alt-m` and the output will be
inserted in a new line.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b3by/atom-math/master/images/example.gif)

### Functions
More complex expressions can be evaluated too.

```
f(x) = x^2 + log(x)
> saved
f(3)
> 10.09861228866811
g(x, y) = 2 + y + f(x)
> saved
g(2, 3)
> 9.693147180559945
```

### Inner commands
`atom-math` is also able to evaluate some inner commands that will not evaluate
any expression through `Math.js`.

Inner commands can be triggered with `/` at the beginning. Commands implemented so
far are:

- `printFunctions` returns a list of all the functions defined in the history
- `clearHistory` empties the history content
- `clipHistory` copies history into clipboard
- `help` prints the full command list

```
f(x) = 1 + 3 * x
> saved
g(x) = 1 - 3 * x
> saved
/functionList
>
f(x) = 1 + 3 * x
g(x) = 1 - 3 * x
/help
> Full command list below
functionList - Print a list of all defined functions
clearHistory - Empty the history
clipHistory - Copy history into clipboard
help - Print the full command list
```

### Definite integration (:exclamation::exclamation:**EXPERIMENTAL**:exclamation::exclamation:)
Definite integration may be executed in `atom-math` with the usage of
[this awesome](https://github.com/scijs/integrate-adaptive-simpson)
package from [scijs](https://github.com/scijs). This feature is **still
unstable**, so it does not behave as expected when provided evaluation
points are floating point. Please refer to [this issue](https://github.com/scijs/integrate-adaptive-simpson/issues/1) to get some examples of how the malfunction can manifest.

The current integrate function status will be tracked [here](https://github.com/b3by/atom-math/issues/7).

## `integrate(functionName, startPoint, endPoint, tolerance)`

A simple integration usage example follows:
```
f(x) = x + 3
> saved
integrate(f, 0, 10, 0.1)
> 80
```

### Command history
Command history can be navigated by using `ctrl-up` and `ctrl-down`. Browsing
the command history implies that the current line is emptied and replaced either
with a command when any is available in that direction, or with an empty line.
